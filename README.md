# BookPriceWebScraping-Analysis

This project demonstrations steps I would take to do some small scale web scraping and statisical analysis for a dataset (less than 200 instances). 

In this mock project, I've been asked to give a price recommendation for a new textbook. I gather book data from Barnes and Nobles, perform web scraping, and use Tableau visuals to help pinpoint the best price.
